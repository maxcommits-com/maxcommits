i'm putting my README.md on github. how do i change the size of my logo?

```markdown
![Max Commits Logo](./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png)
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

In **Markdown** (such as in GitHub READMEs), you *cannot* directly set the size of an image using Markdown syntax alone:

```markdown
![Alt Text](url)
```

### Workarounds

#### 1. Use HTML `<img>` Tag

GitHub READMEs support inline HTML, so you can use the `<img>` tag and set the `width` (or `height`):

```html
<img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="200"/>
```

- Change the `width` (or add `height`) to what you need.
- Example (150px wide):
  ```html
  <img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="150"/>
  ```

#### 2. Markdown-Only (No direct support)

Markdown's image syntax does **not** let you control size.

----

**Summary:**  
Use the HTML `<img>` tag with a `width` or `height` attribute in your `README.md`. This works on GitHub. Example:

```html
<img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="150"/>
```

**Note:** If you need the image to scale responsively, do not set both `width` and `height` (unless you want to maintain aspect ratio). You can use only `width` or only `height`.

the image didn't load. however, i'm quite sure it is there. do i need to use "github.com" in the URL? or can i do a relative path somehow?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great question!  
You **can use relative paths** in your `README.md` as long as:

- The image file is included in your repository, **and**
- The relative path is correct (relative to the location of your `README.md` file).

**You do _not_ need to use "github.com" in the URL if you are linking to a file in your repo.**

---

## Common Issues

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Paths and filenames on GitHub are case-sensitive.  
   If your file is named `max-Commits-3.PNG`, but your path says `max-commits-3.png`, it won't load.

2. **Path correctness**:
    - If your structure is:
      ```
      .
      ├── README.md
      └── raw-icons/
          └── max-commits-3.png
      ```
      Then this should work:
      ```markdown
      ![Max Commits Logo](./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png)
      ```
      or with HTML:
      ```html
      <img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="150"/>
      ```

3. **Uncommitted/Unpushed Files**:  
   Make sure you've committed and pushed `raw-icons/max-commits-3.png` to your remote repo.

## How To Debug

- **Check the file path and case!**
- **Browse your repo on GitHub:**  
  Navigate to the image in the GitHub file browser and click it. If you can see the image, the path (case included) should work in your README.md.
- **Check for typos** in folder names or image filenames.

---

## Absolute GitHub URLs

You can also use an absolute raw URL.  
Click your image on GitHub, then click "Download" or "Raw", and copy that URL. It'll look like:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/raw-icons/max-commits-3.png
```

Then in your README:

```markdown
![Max Commits Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/raw-icons/max-commits-3.png)
```

Or, for sizing:

```html
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" width="150" alt="Max Commits Logo"/>
```

---

**Summary:**  
- Relative paths work if the file is present, the path (with correct casing) is correct, and committed/pushed.
- If struggling, use the raw.githubusercontent.com URL.

If you share your repo structure or link, I can give more specific guidance!

what's the best size/style for a logo in my header?

# <img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="40"/> Max Commits

Great question! Here are some guidelines and best practices for a logo in the header of a GitHub README:

---

## **Best Practices for Logo in README Header**

### **1. Size**
- **Width:** 32–48 pixels is standard for a small logo next to your project name.
- **Example:**  
  ```html
  <img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="40"/>
  ```
- You can adjust if your logo looks too large/small; aim for it to line up nicely with the header text.

### **2. Style**
- **Aspect Ratio:** Make sure the logo is not stretched or squished. Use only `width` or only `height`, not both, so it scales proportionally.
- **Image Type:** PNG with transparent background (for best results on both dark and light GitHub themes).
- **Simplicity:** Keep the logo clean—too many details won’t be visible at small sizes.

### **3. Placement**
- Recommended in the first header like this:
  ```markdown
  # <img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="40"/> Max Commits
  ```
- You can also place the logo above the title:
  ```markdown
  <p align="center">
    <img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="80"/>
  </p>
  <h1 align="center">Max Commits</h1>
  ```

---

## **Visual Example**
```markdown
# <img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="40"/> Max Commits
```

_or centered:_
```markdown
<p align="center">
  <img src="./raw-icons/max-commits-3.png" alt="Max Commits Logo" width="80"/>
</p>
<h1 align="center">Max Commits</h1>
```

## **A Few More Tips**
- If your logo is dark, consider adding a very subtle white stroke or shadow so it’s visible on both light and dark GitHub themes.
- SVGs can be used, but GitHub sometimes restricts SVG rendering due to security.
- Test how your README looks in both light and dark modes on GitHub.

---

**In summary:**  
Your current style is good! `width="40"` is a typical and readable size. You can tweak slightly if needed, but keeping the logo simple and sized closely to the text is the best approach for most projects.
